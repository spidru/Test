On that same day, Moody’s Investors Service took an axe to the speculative-grade credit ratings of Cengage Learning Inc. and McGraw-Hill LLC, two of the largest producers of college course materials. It dropped both companies from B3 to Caa2, nearly the lowest rating possible without actually missing debt payments. The outlook for each of them is negative, a sign that Moody’s views some sort of default as likely. A week earlier, it cut market-leader Pearson Plc to the brink of junk.RELATED:  Covid-19 Shows That Scientific Journals Need to Open UpThe college textbook industry looks as if it may face a reckoning as the U.S. academic year begins, much like the rental-car business did in the early days of the pandemic. Almost six months into America’s coronavirus crisis, credit investors should see the common themes among companies that can’t outlast the virus’s reshaping of the U.S. economy. Hertz Corp., for instance, had to file for bankruptcy because it had too much debt relative to its peers to withstand the sharp drop in rental-car demand. Similarly, Moody’s said its downgrade of McGraw-Hill “reflects the company’s persistently high financial leverage” and “its debt-heavy capital structure that Moody’s deems unsustainable.” Cengage, too, has “a heavy debt burden,” which, combined with an anticipated drop in earnings, raises “concerns about sustainability of the company’s capital structure.” Cengage and McGraw-Hill are both owned by private-equity firms.By now, it’s clear that Covid-19 will shake up higher education unlike anything in recent memory, though whether the trends are fleeting or permanent remain to be seen. Most universities have benefited from decades of tuition price increases that vastly outpaced inflation and insatiable demand from students in the U.S. and abroad. That means all but the most strapped colleges will most likely survive what’s sure to be a peculiar school year.College textbook publishers, on the other hand, have been reeling for years. My Bloomberg Opinion colleague Justin Fox did a deep dive on the industry in early February that showed the cost of educational books and supplies has flatlined since 2016, thanks to a combination of used-textbook sales and rentals and the proliferation of digital offerings, both from established publishers and non-profits. Not only was this pressure evident before the coronavirus pandemic struck in the U.S., but six months ago Cengage and McGraw-Hill were in the middle of a merger, which would have combined their respective 21.8% and 15.9% share of revenue in the U.S. market for new college course materials to rival Pearson’s 42.7%, presumably giving them more pricing power. Three months later, they terminated the agreement because of a prolonged regulatory review process and the failure to agree on divestitures with the Justice Department.Put together, it’s an industry dominated by a few companies that had planned to shift their business models in the face of structural changes toward digital learning, the rise of free-textbook efforts and the outlook for a shrinking undergraduate population. To use the rental-car comparison, it’s similar to how Hertz, Avis Budget Group Inc. and Enterprise Holdings Inc. had to wrestle with the emergence of Uber Technologies Inc. and other ride-sharing services.As low-rated as they may be, Cengage and McGraw-Hill both have digital offerings in place — in fact, Cengage Chief Executive Officer Michael Hansen was named one of the “most creative people in business” by Fast Company for “creating a revolutionary (and affordable) rental model for college textbooks.” While Moody’s says the companies are positioned favorably in the higher-education market as remote learning ramps up, it doesn’t mean they can avoid defaulting on their debt. Here’s a key passage from Moody’s:As affordability of textbooks and learning materials are important to students and higher education institutions, less expensive alternatives to print textbooks emerged. This social trend resulted in a multi-year precipitous decline in average spend per student on learning materials. Publishers, including [Cengage/McGraw], are responding by growing digital offerings that provide extra value to students. The coronavirus outbreak is accelerating the transformational social changes impacting [Cengage/McGraw] and its peers.That’s a powerful assessment. Since March, Moody’s analysts appear to have used the word “precipitous” only 10 other times across global credit markets, in reference to steep declines in the price of oil and aluminum, the drop-off in leisure and business travel, and the financial performance of a Pennsylvania health system. That’s it — those things, and spending on college learning materials.The bond market is also taking a harsh stance. McGraw-Hill debt maturing in May 2024 traded this week at 58.5 cents on the dollar, the lowest since May and equivalent to a yield of almost 26%, while Cengage securities due a month later traded at about 67 cents to yield 22.8%. As bad as that seems, the bonds changed hands at less than 40 cents on the dollar in early May. As I wrote last month, investors have been digging through the riskiest corporate securities to separate distress from doom. It’s possible that some opportunistic credit buyers determined that Cengage and McGraw-Hill won’t have to cut their debt as much as previously feared.A nationwide failure among colleges to bring back in-person learning could complicate that calculation. The University of Notre Dame said on Tuesday that it would shift to online instruction for at least two weeks after 147 people tested positive for the coronavirus just as the fall semester began, while Michigan State University sent a letter on the same day that urged undergraduates to stay home rather than live in campus housing. Whether it’s the right decision or not, as many as one out of five students may opt for a gap year in 2020-2021 because they can’t get the full college experience. A near-total loss of hard-copy textbook sales, combined with a plunge in enrollment, would seemingly leave Cengage and McGraw-Hill with a revenue hole too big to escape.To borrow a line from my Bloomberg Opinion colleague Noah Smith, there are no good choices for the entire economic ecosystem tied to college life. Universities themselves are sure to take a financial hit, as will businesses in college towns across the country. I’m not convinced that Covid-19 will ignite the much-ballyhooed shift away from higher education, but the outlook for the coming school year is severe enough that it looks as if weak hands will have to fold.That could mean distressed-debt exchanges from the likes of Cengage and McGraw-Hill, whose bonds were trading above 90 cents in February. It would be yet another painful lesson for investors about how highly leveraged companies can quickly falter in the face of a unforeseen shock.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brian Chappatta is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering debt markets.

Maybe that's why you're considering Hertz (NYSE:HTZ). Even though Hertz stock is in bankruptcy, you're thinking you see something that other investors haven't identified.Source: aureliefrance / Shutterstock.com Stop.Just stop it, at least when it comes to Hertz stock.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsBecause the rental car company is not coming back -- it was in serious trouble even before the novel coronavirus pandemic. And now that air travel remains down by 70% from last year, rental car companies that make the bulk of their case at airports are suffering.Let's look at why Hertz is a terrible investment. And if you're still not convinced after reading the evidence, I'll give you three other investment ideas that, while terrible, all have a better chance of giving you better returns than you'll get from Hertz stock. The Truth About Hertz StockHertz is the nation's second-largest car rental company, but it won't be for long. The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on May 22, citing nearly $19 billion in debt and an idle rental car fleet of 700,000 cars.The situation is so dire that the company's largest shareholder, Carl Icahn, sold 55.3 million shares of the company at an average price of 72 cents per share, giving him a $1.8 billion loss on his investment. At the time, Icahn had a nearly 39% stake in Hertz.A Chapter 11 restructuring means that creditors would have to settle for less than full repayment of Hertz's debts, and the company could continue to operate. That's better than a Chapter 7 filing, which means the company liquidates its assets.  * 6 International Stocks to Buy for Impressive Returns Now Hertz tried to raise $500 million in a post-bankruptcy stock offering -- which was weird, considering the company has repeatedly warned investors that Hertz stock will likely wind up to be worthless.Investors on the trading app Robinhood were likely responsible for what happened next. As Hertz became one of the most-traded stocks on Robinhood, Hertz stock rose by a factor of 10, from 55 cents per share to $5.53. Even now, Hertz stock is trading near $1.50 per share, double for what Icahn settled for when he bailed out.At the end of the day, Hertz's bizarre stock offering failed, raising only $29 million as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission raised lots of questions. In a regulatory filing, the company says it now plans to seek debtor-in-possession financing in an effort to remain afloat. Here's the Financial PictureHertz says that it sold off 100,000 cars in June and July and needs to dump another 182,000 vehicles. It says it has $1.4 billion in cash on hand, and needs to see a recovery key markets, as well as an extension from creditors in Europe and the United Kingdom beyond Sept. 30.For the second quarter, Hertz lost $587 million on $832 million in revenue. The per-share loss came in at $3.51, which was worse than the $2.33 per share analysts expected. Investments That Are Better Than HertzInvesting in Hertz is an awful idea. Even Icahn, who had nearly 39% of the company, knew it was past time to bail out and took a $1.8 billion loss just to shed his shares.But if you are determined to throw your money away on Hertz stock, then maybe you'll be tempted by these three ideas. Each of them is a horrible way to invest, but each is a better idea than Hertz.Lottery tickets: The odds of winning the PowerBall jackpot are at 1 in 292 million, while the odds of winning the Mega Millions jackpot are 1 in 302 million. Both of those are truly awful, but I'll give you a better chance of making your money with lottery tickets than in hitting it lucky with Hertz stock.Nigerian prince scams: Yeah, these so-called solicitations that are always hitting your email are fake. And some people are still falling for them, with CNBC reporting last year that the email scams cost victims more than $700,000.But if you answer, you can at least make a new pen pal, right? And if you're smarter than the scammer, you can have some fun of your own.Setting your money on fire: Seriously, if you're going to lose money with Hertz stock, you're better off setting it on fire. At least you'll have a few seconds of warmth as your dollars go up in flames -- and that's more than you'll get from HTZ. The Bottom LineObviously, I went tongue in cheek with those suggestions, but it's to make a point. Hertz stock is a bad investment. If you own Hertz, follow Icahn's lead and bail out now, despite whatever loss you may incur.And if you are thinking about taking a new position in Hertz stock, just back away. Get out before you do something you'll really regret.Patrick Sanders is a freelance writer and editor in Maryland, and from 2015 to 2019 was head of the investment advice section at U.S. News &amp; World Report.

Not Right Now, Says Analyst</title><link>TipRanks</link><description>That former rental car giant Hertz (HTZ) is a company in turmoil will come as a surprise to no one. The company was already riddled with debt before the pandemic’s onset, and now it is in the midst of the bankruptcy process, after the coronavirus’ destruction of the travel industry has left it in tatters. But the bad news keeps piling up and it appears management are jumping out of a car seemingly on the road to nowhere.Last week, Hertz announced that CFO Jamere Jackson has resigned to move on to pastures a new and will be replaced by the company’s former Chief Accounting Officer and Controller.For Deutsche Bank analyst Chris Woronka, the news is hardly surprising. The analyst expects more departures while the company’s “restructuring process carries on and various roles are redefined, created, or eliminated.”Far more pertinent for Hertz’ future, Woronka argues, is the recent agreement with ABS creditors, which stated the company will sell 183,000 cars between June and the end of the year in order to pay $650 million to the lenders who financed its rental car fleet.Woronka estimates, that “as long as the residual market remains cooperative over the period, HTZ could reduce the size of its ABS balance by at least 51% while maintaining a loan to value of approximately 90% (or less).”“Ultimately, however,” the analyst added, “We still see considerable risks to the HTZ recovery story, and we don't anticipate having a meaningfully clearer picture until the fall travel season unfolds and we get additional data points on the sustainability of recent strength in the used car market.”Accordingly, Woronka reduced his 2020 adjusted EBITDA estimate by $355 million to $1.236 billion and expects a 7% increase in U.S. fleet costs (per unit/per month), “with a flattish result in the second half of the year.”Woronka’s rating remains a Hold, although alongside the estimate reduction, the price target gets a trim, too. The figure comes down from $3 to $2. Nevertheless, the very risk tolerant investor could be pocketing a 38% gain, should Woronka’s target be met over the next 12 months.

And although that is not a bad strategy, one should always look for fundamental value when investing in a company. With "blockchain mania" in full swing, that attitude often goes out the window in favor of herd instinct. That's why you should avoid Marathon Patent (NASDAQ:MARA) stock, even though it is rallying.Source: Shutterstock Year-to-date, shares are up more than 100%, although they have lost their way a bit since reaching a 52-week high of $5.25. Still, the share performance is good enough for several retail investors to wonder whether it's time to believe the hype and pour capital in MARA stock.However, it pains me to burst their bubble and say that MARA stock still does not have a long-term growth story.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading Tips Robinhood Traders Lose the PlotIn many of my columns, I have underlined how Robinhood app traders are unrealistically propping up shares. We've seen examples of several bankrupt companies like Hertz (NYSE:HTZ) and JCPenney (OTCMKTS:JCPNQ) experiencing extraordinary spikes in share prices.  * 7 Sin Stocks to Buy Now as America ReopensMany analysts treat Robinhood app traders as the ultimate novices in investing. College students that make their trades based on instinct rather than fundamentals, Robinhood app traders are used by the market nowadays to assess which stocks to avoid.The latest spike follows the purchase of new next-generation M31S+ ASIC Miners from MicroBT. The move comes after the company registered a $100 million shelf offering. Proceeds from the offering will be used to make the acquisitions. The company has said that the installation of these new machines will make it cash-flow positive.As InvestorPlace's Matt McCall laid out, that is still a tall order since revenues and operating costs are where its troubles lie:As for free cash flow (FCF), the company has been operating as a negative FCF entity for some time now. Management's expectation is reportedly for that to change soon. While in theory, the business model is solid, this is an expensive operation to get up and running. This makes it a tough business to thrive in -- and helps explain why the stock has struggled so much.We don't have any new information on how revenues will rise, or costs will fall. It's tough to say that cash flows will become positive just based on MARA's latest acquisition. Revenues for the year are still shy of $1 million, while costs have already outstripped sales, not a great place to be if you are thinking of turning around a company's fortunes. There Are Better Options in the MarketBlockchain is still a relative unknown. Stocks in the space remain risky because you can't rely on traditional metrics to assess this sector. That's why analysts always suggest approaching this area with caution, or you stand to get substantially burned. MARA stock relies on cryptocurrencies gaining value and acceptability moving forward. Although I am all for decentralized currency, governments the world over have been averse to accepting cryptocurrencies.So, although you will always hear the odd story of a cryptocurrency millionaire, the ground reality remains very different. Also, what makes MARA stock particularly unattractive at this moment is the state of the market.Any deep value investor must be loving where we are at the moment. That's why it seems a bit too risky investing in MARA when there are no fundamentals to back your decision. At a time when most stocks are trailing their 52-week highs by a fair margin, MARA stock presents a dangerous position to open. Invest in MARA Stock at Your Own RiskThere is nothing to suggest MARA stock is a viable investment at this point. Its decision to invest in new machines may or may not lead to positive cash flows. However, any future finance that will come from the shelf offering will dilute shareholding by a fair margin. Brownie points received due to positive free cash flow will soon vanish for the average retail investor.And we are not even considering the overarching issue of cryptocurrency volatility at this point. Any way you slice it, there is nothing to suggest that MARA has a long-term strategy that is worth your capital. Stay away from it until you see any signs of fundamental strength.Disclosure: On the date of publication, Faizan Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

And that's before you adjust for inflation.In the shorter term, MRO tantalized investors with a steady run-up of five-plus years, starting in 2009, that led to an all-time high of $41.69 per share on Aug. 29, 2014. Close to that date, though, energy stocks began to go south. Eighteen months after its peak, MRO stock had lopped off more than 80% of its value. MRO Stock Befuddles as a Robinhood FaveAs for the experts, most aren't so enthusiastic about MRO shares, though they're not dismissive either. Wall Street Journal analyst rankings fall heavily on the hold side, where 17 have cast their lot compared to six calling MRO a buy and three a sell. Consensus on the stock has been hold, in fact, for at least the last three months.Assuming you want to hit the reset button on Marathon's financials to begin on March 9, right about the time Covid-19 began to sweep the U.S., then MRO stock is up more than a third and currently trades just shy of $5 a share. So as it's still on the lower end of low, there's a case to be made for buying in now while the stock is cheap. But not much of one.As has been the case with Hertz (NYSE:HTZ), Workhorse Group (NASDAQ:WKHS) and JC Penney (OTCMKTS:JCPNQ), we can attribute Marathon's mini-rally to the amateur investors who use Robinhood. Just 10,000 Robinhood users held MRO in the first week of March; by mid-August, the numbers had spiraled upwards of 187,000. The Well Has Run DryFrom where I sit, that's six digits worth of irrational exuberance. As for a more relevant number to the smart investor, let's look at Marathon's profit. There's isn't any. Even Wall Street projections reflect the lowest of expectations, as a Q3 earnings beat would mean a loss of less than 20 cents per share.Now we're inching into dangerous territory for serious investors. To review, a) MRO is a buy-and-hold loser; b) the energy sector has been a rut for years; c) that rut shows no signs of reversing anytime soon; and d) the stock's recent run-up, humble as it is, looks strongly connected to the herd mentality of Robinhood traders.That's not to say that a short play on Marathon could never reap a benefit. But I'd argue that's definite market timing territory. You'd need to get in and out at just the right time, while selecting a very subjective, I've-got-a-hunch price target.The analysts say hold. If you go a step further and just hold on to your cash--as rotten a strategy as that is, right?--you'd still come out, to quote a certain oil company's slogan, best in the long run.On the date of publication, Lou Carlozo did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Tschirhart, according to the objection filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Delaware.The bonus program is “a fairly transparent attempt to continue doling out cash in a manner similar to the $16.2 million that already has been bestowed upon favored employees,” the employees said, referring to payments Hertz made to top executives just before it filed bankruptcy in May.In bankruptcy, deferred compensation is ranked behind bonus payments to current employees, so if Hertz doesn’t have enough to pay all its debts, the seven former executives are unlikely to collect everything they are owed.Hertz is asking U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Mary Walrath for permission to make incentive payments to Chief Executive Paul Stone and other top managers. The company is also seeking permission to pay as much as $9.2 million to 295 other, lower-ranking employees.The U.S. Trustee, an arm of the U.S. Department of Justice that monitors big, corporate bankruptcies, also opposed the bonus programs, saying they are not truly designed to give the workers an incentive to perform, but are merely retention payments.The case is Hertz Corp. 20-11218, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">Bloomberg</guid><enclosure url="https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/NXTrigxXRUxJoJEm5RWINQ--~B/Zmk9ZmlsbDtoPTEyMztweW9mZj0wO3E9ODA7dz0yMjA7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/7T1SzemOOaTFfZxn6I3Xfw--~B/aD0xMzM0O3c9MjAwMDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/601181bd72721ff7b08c7b38c04c8e8d" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>Post-Bankruptcy, Whiting Petroleum an Intriguing Choice for Oil Bulls</title><link>InvestorPlace</link><description>As it turns out, buying Whiting Petroleum (NYSE:WLL) stock in bankruptcy wasn't a great deal. Between shares of the "new" WLL stock and warrants, early trading suggests that pre-bankruptcy prices were too high, even after a big pullback.Source: Shutterstock Whiting was a better story than Hertz (NYSE:HTZ) is likely to be, but that's clearing a low bar: HTZ remains a longshot bet on a massive recovery in used car prices.Investors were wise to stay away. Former shareholders only are getting about 3% of the company; bondholders are getting the rest. Warrants have some value, but even accounting for that value pre-bankruptcy shareholders paid too much.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsBut the same won't necessarily be true going forward. The bankruptcy process significantly improved Whiting's balance sheet. Even with a rally in WLL stock over the past few sessions, valuation looks attractive.  * 7 Sin Stocks to Buy Now as America ReopensCertainly, the new Whiting has plenty of risks as well. Crude oil prices remain low. U.S. production still needs to come down to match demand, and that will take some time, if it happens at all.Meanwhile, it's certainly fair to ask if WLL stock is necessarily the best producer out there - and if the sector's history of value destruction means investors should own producers at all. For those investors still interested in oil plays, however, there's a real case for the "new" WLL stock. The RestructuringCertainly, some investors were far too optimistic toward Whiting stock before the bankruptcy. In June, for instance, WLL stock soared as part of a pack that included Hertz and Chesapeake Energy (OTCMKTS:CHKAQ). (Chesapeake hadn't yet filed for bankruptcy, but such a move seemed imminent, and indeed arrived later that month.)Investors who bought that rally are down big. Those who waited for it to fade, however, didn't get hurt quite as badly.In the restructuring, pre-bankruptcy Whiting shares were converted to "new" WLL stock at an exchange ratio of roughly one share for every 75 shares previously owned. With WLL closing Tuesday at $20.93, new equity was worth about 28 cents per "old" Whiting share.But the warrants have real value as well. Shareholders received one Series A warrant (OTCMKTS:WLLAW) per every 19.1 shares. Those warrants expire in 2024, with an exercise price of $73.44. They last traded Tuesday at $4.40.Shareholders also received one Series B warrant (OTCMKTS:WLLBW) for every 38.2 shares. Those warrants mature in 2025, with a strike of $83.45. They closed Tuesday just shy of $5.Add it up, and investors received about 63 cents in value for their Whiting stock. (28 cents for the equity, 23 cents for the Series A warrant, and 13 cents for the Series B issue.) That may change in a hurry: both WLL stock and the warrants already have shown significant volatility, and likely will continue to do so.At the moment, the payout suggests that investors were too optimistic toward the bankruptcy process. WLL stock closed on Aug. 31 at 80 cents; it disclosed the exchange arrangements the following day. The simple wisdom was (mostly) correct: it's almost always unwise to buy a stock in bankruptcy. WLL Stock Going ForwardAfter bankruptcy, however, is a different story. Former Whiting shareholders only received 3% of the equity, but they're receiving a much smaller portion of a company in far better shape.After all, in the bankruptcy Whiting managed to cancel some $3 billion in debt. Borrowings now total just $425 million. As the company noted in an investor presentation, that gives Whiting one of the lowest leverage ratios in the industry - after it had one of the highest before the restructuring.Valuation looks reasonable as well. In the same presentation, Whiting noted that its 2021 business plan forecast $300 million in EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization). Pro forma market capitalization sits just under $800 million; enterprise value (market cap plus net debt) is just over $1.2 billion.An EV/EBITDA multiple around 4x is rather attractive for the sector - even with low crude prices. (That business plan, issued in June, likely will be updated later this year. But the estimated oil and natural gas prices aren't far off from where they sit right now.) An advisor to the bankruptcy valued the enterprise at closer to $1.5 billion. Meanwhile, Whiting should be free cash flow positive, assuming its business plan is on point.There's also a qualitative argument for the stock, as detailed in the same presentation. On Slide 4, Whiting detailed where U.S. independent producers had "gone wrong" - and how the company's strategy would be different. No longer will Whiting outspend free cash flow or chase production over profits. This time, under largely new management, will be different. The RisksOf course, that strategy in its own way highlights a key risk. Investors have heard those promises before not just in oil and gas, but in other industries.The most obvious example is airlines. They, too, promised they wouldn't chase growth for growth's sake. Capital allocation would be smarter. Shareholder value would be a priority. The industry promptly spent nearly all of its free cash flow on stock buybacks, leaving it reliant on federal assistance when disaster struck earlier this year.Will this time really be different for Whiting? The new managers come from Kodiak Oil &amp; Gas, which Whiting purchased for $6 billion in 2014. Obviously, that acquisition was a disaster for Whiting, and in fact the key driver of this year's bankruptcy. Will Kodiak's executives learn from their acquirer's mistake?The other question is whether the sector as a whole is investable. The shale revolution has made a lot of money for executives and even oil field workers. Investors, with only a few exceptions, have generally lost out. If WLL stock is one of the better plays in the space, is it necessarily a good play?Oil bulls might argue that it is. But on that thesis, a post-bankruptcy Whiting has some concerns as well. Perhaps the best "go big or go home" play in the sector probably is highly leveraged Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY). Chevron (NYSE:CVX) offers a more diversified (and lower-risk) option. And there are no shortage of independent producers which are far cheaper than they were years ago.Add it up, and it's hard to necessarily pound the table for WLL stock. But the stock is cheap. The bankruptcy has served its immediate purpose. This can work - but oil prices and management need to cooperate.On the date of publication, Vince Martin did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Its share price soared as much as 166% Wednesday, minting fortunes inside the company and across Silicon Valley.Shares of the cloud-data software maker opened at $245 -- more than double its IPO price -- in New York trading. That 104% gain at the opening bell was the third-highest such pop for an IPO of $1 billion or more on a U.S. exchange and the biggest since Florida-based equipment rental company Herc Holdings Inc. went public in 2006.Snowflake sold 28 million shares at $120 apiece on Tuesday. They were earlier marketed for $100 to $110 each after the range was boosted from $75 to $85.The shares, which reached as high as $319, closed up 112% to $253.93 in New York trading, giving it a market value approaching six times the $12.4 billion it received in a private funding round in February.Uber, DellThat makes Snowflake, previously a lesser-known firm based in San Mateo, California, more valuable than Uber Technologies Inc., Dell Technologies Inc. and General Motors Co., according to data compiled by Bloomberg.“So far, so good,” Snowflake Chief Executive Officer Frank Slootman said in an interview. “IPOs for us are milestones along the way. They’re not endpoints. We needed to do this for a number of reasons, especially to raise the stature of the company in the marketplace.”Slootman said that he’s spent a year speaking with institutional investors about backing Snowflake, and now hopes they will maintain large stakes for at least five to 10 years. He wanted shareholders who weren’t just looking for “momentum,” he added.Comparing an IPO to the switch from college football in the U.S. to the pros, he said, “I sometimes refer to it as we go from playing on Saturday to playing on Sunday.”MORE: Snowflake IPO Creates Flood of Wealth for Silicon Valley EliteWith IPOs roaring back after a spring lull as the coronavirus pandemic hit the U.S., Snowflake’s listing is this year’s largest on a U.S. exchange by an operating company, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That excludes the $4 billion raised in July by a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, backed by billionaire investor Bill Ackman.U.S. IPOs are having a busy week as 21 companies are expected to price their offerings raising more than $10 billion combined, according to the data.JFrog JumpsJFrog Ltd., which makes tools for software developers, closed up 47% to $64.79 after jumping as much as 75% in its trading debut Wednesday following a $509 million offering. Also on Wednesday, Unity Software Inc. elevated the price target to raise as much as $1.2 billion its IPO set for Thursday.Snowflake’s IPO attracted Warren Buffett for a rare investment. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and Salesforce Ventures, an arm of Salesforce.com Inc., have each committed to buy $250 million of the company’s Class A common stock in a private placement. Berkshire also agreed to buy 4 million shares in a secondary transaction, according to Snowflake’s filing.Founded in 2012, Snowflake is a challenger to Amazon.com Inc. as a provider of data warehouse technology, which compiles information from different systems so clients can analyze it together in the same place. In the fiscal year that ended Jan. 31, Snowflake’s revenue soared 174% to $264.7 million compared with the previous year, the company reported. In the sixth months ended July 31, the company lost $171 million on revenue of $242 million.Data ‘Exploding’“Data is exploding,” said Carl Eschenbach, a partner at Snowflake investor Sequoia who’s also on the software company’s board. “There is no centralized data cloud other than Snowflake that can combine all of that data and give you the business insights you want in a very fast way.”Eschenbach added, “We are still in the early innings of companies moving their data to the cloud.”Daniel Elman, an analyst at Nucleus Research, said Snowflake’s IPO surge is a culmination of the broader success of cloud-based companies.“Momentum has been building where cloud has gone from a proof of concept or for things that were less critical to companies realizing it will enable a much more agile and modern architecture and working style,” Elman said in an interview.Snowflake’s offering was led by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley.

Walrath’s order also nixed a new plan that would have split as much as $9.2 million among about 295 lower-ranking managers.“It seems offensive to give senior executives bonuses” when some of them got retention payments immediately before Hertz headed for court, Walrath said in a hearing held by telephone on Thursday.Under the pre-bankruptcy retention plan, Chief Executive Officer Paul Stone received $700,000. With the new plan, Stone could have collected as much as $1.6 million.Bonus CurbsThe U.S. Bankruptcy Code restricts bonus payments to top executives, in part by requiring them to be tied to performance goals. Retention payments are allowed, but have tighter restrictions that make them harder to justify.Congress wrote the rules to ensure managers who drove a company into bankruptcy were not rewarded for staying around during a Chapter 11 case, Walrath said.“More has to be done to show why employees who got retention bonuses and agreed to stay with the company are not going to do their best to see that the company survives and succeeds,” Walrath said.Representatives for the company, based in Estero, Florida, didn’t immediately return an email seeking comment.Revisions NeededThe judge will consider approving the bonuses if the company either submits better information to justify the payments, or revises the financial and business targets that Hertz must hit for the employees to get paid.A “relatively large percentage” of the employees who would be eligible for the new bonus program also got retention bonuses, Hertz bankruptcy attorney Jason Zakia said during the hearing.As part of the original deal, employees agreed to forgo their 2020 bonuses, Bloomberg Law previously reported. The new bonuses “are in reality the 2020 bonuses under a different name,” the U.S. Trustee has said.A group of retired Hertz executives, including former general counsel Paul M. Tschirhart, and the U.S. Trustee’s Office argued that the program doesn’t meet the legal standards for paying bonuses in bankruptcy.The case is Hertz Corp. 20-11218, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">Bloomberg</guid><enclosure url="https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/MVDRsHgVFOjVJ_92.PWGSQ--~B/Zmk9ZmlsbDtoPTEyMztweW9mZj0wO3E9ODA7dz0yMjA7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/6TJHcHPTVEVEYEV6o6Gafg--~B/aD0xMzM0O3c9MjAwMDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/78bced7e226ee4651561b4aafd5c9424" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>Stock Investors Are Younger and More Racially Diverse</title><link>Bloomberg</link><description>(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Brokerage firms such as Robinhood Financial LLC, zero-commission trading, the surge in exchange-traded funds and the growth in fractional share ownership have all had a hand in luring a new generation of investors to the stock market in recent years. If anything, the Covid-19 pandemic has accelerated the trends, as evidenced by the unnaturally high prices paid for shares of bankrupt Hertz Global Holdings Inc.  or Tesla Inc.’s soaring stock price.Now comes a new Yahoo Finance Harris poll that reveals other changes in the investing landscape that have far-reaching implications for both the government and companies. For one, more than half the racial gap in individual stock ownership has disappeared essentially overnight. Also, both younger and older Americans are now more likely to own stocks than those in their prime, middle-age asset accumulation years. More than one-third of those middle-aged investors have greatly reduced their stock holdings.What does it mean? Of course, it could turn out to just be a millennial fad, or a transitory effect of the lockdowns, or even just an outlier survey. But if the results represent a long-term trend they could overturn some long-held assumptions. For one, the political appeal of running an anti-Wall Street platform may not be as effective among young and non-White voters as in the past. And claiming credit for good stock market performance might not matter as much to middle-aged White voters.Public corporations may find that their individual shareholders are becoming more diverse than their executive ranks and boards. Most of the pressure to date for corporate diversity has come from institutional shareholders. Individual shareholders seldom vote, and while the new, young and non-White shareholders probably don’t represent a significant block of shares, the cultural view of public companies is very much influenced by shareholder characteristics. Companies that can win the loyalty of new investors, especially younger ones, can enjoy relatively cheaper and more secure capital over long periods of time – as evidenced by Tesla.The table below shows the percentage of U.S. households owning at least one individual stock not held in a retirement account from the 2016 Survey of Consumer Finances and the September 2020 YFH poll, by race.Owning individual stocks has a large effect on people’s attitudes in politics, financial decisions and cultural identification. It’s true that all Americans have a stake in the stock market, with more than half exposed through mutual funds and retirement accounts. Workers covered by public pensions are indirectly exposed because the ability of funds to make promised payments depends on the stock market’s performance. Even people with no assets linked to stocks are helped when the market goes up because it tends to lead to more jobs and higher wages. But these kinds of indirect exposures are less intense than what investors who pick and own individual stocks directly feel.While the chart above shows the total change since 2016, there is reason to believe that most of it occurred in 2020. The next chart addresses that idea, asking respondents who owned individual stocks if they reduced or increased holdings in 2020. The remainder said they kept their stock investments about the same.Similar percentages reduced holdings among all races, but Blacks and especially Hispanics were much more likely than Whites to increase.Young and old people were more likely to own individual stocks in 2020 than 2016, but in the prime middle-age asset accumulation years, more than one-third of individual stockholders sold off their stocks. A 40-year-old is now more likely to own individual stocks than a 60-year-old.These huge demographic changes have occurred without much change in stockholding patterns by income, education, family type, home ownership or region—factors normally considered more important to investment behavior.The stock market was invented mainly for older, wealthy, white men and any movement toward broadening the base was scotched by the Great Depression. It wasn’t until the Baby Boomers reached working age that the market began to democratize, mainly via low-cost index funds and equity selections in tax-deferred retirement accounts, and the change did not take strongly among non-whites.Generation X imitated its parents, but as Millennials reach working ages a new paradigm may be emerging—aggressive equity participation by young people of all races, centered on active trading of individual stocks. The dollar amounts are small today, but the long-term impact on markets, the economy and society could be profound.The Elizabethan poet Thomas Nashe wrote “A Litany in Time of Plague” in which he warned, “Rich men, trust not in wealth, Gold cannot buy you health.” Millions of non-rich Americans, mostly young and non-White, are using this time of plague to start trusting in stocks. That may prove to be one of the bigger social changes from pandemic.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Aaron Brown is a former managing director and head of financial market research at AQR Capital Management.

The proposals came from a group of Hertz’s unsecured creditors and a separate set of first-lien creditors, the person said. The offers aren’t yet formal and could fall through as the parties work on the details, the people added.A representative for Estero, Florida-based Hertz didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.Hertz filed for bankruptcy in May without a customary debtor-in-possession loan already in place, opting instead to rely on a large stockpile of cash on hand. The company first disclosed it would seek a DIP loan in August, after its attempt to raise money by selling potentially worthless shares failed.Cash ConcernsThe company meanwhile has resolved a standoff with lenders over leases on its fleet and benefited from rebounding used-vehicle prices.Hertz said in a previous filing that it’s looking for new sources of cash. The travel business remains in a deep slump and much of the proceeds from vehicle sales have been going to pay off creditors.Hertz had sought to avoid raising traditional bankruptcy funding while it negotiated a debt restructuring with asset-backed securities holders who indirectly control the company’s rental car fleet.The rental firm ultimately agreed to pay the lenders $650 million to cover 2020 lease obligations, an amount that’s likely less than what it would normally owe to cover lease payments and depreciation costs. Even so, weak demand in its core business and pandemic-related uncertainty leaves it in need of more cash.Revenue fell 67% in the second quarter from a year earlier, leading to a $587 million loss.
